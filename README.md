# yourmorningnews

Hello, Your Morning News is a student project made while i was in my Fullstack dev bootcamp at La Capsule.

It was done in 5 days using REACT-REDUX / Node / JS

With this project i learned : Redux with React, hash password using bcrypt and using token to identifed a user

The app is using TheNewsAPI : https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started 

It provides you the latest top-headlines from your region (you can switch from french news to english news) and allows you to browse 
between different sources. 

You can add articles to your wishlist and it will be saved in a database. It allows you to get back your wishlist's articles to read 
them at your next connection.

The SIGN-UP process will hash the user's password with bcrypt and also create a token (using uid2) to identified the user for his futur connections.

Currently there is a bug i still need to fix one day : the image from the article in your wishlist will not display at your next connection.

Made with a combination of motivation and desesperance while trying to use Redux for the first time, but i get it now !
